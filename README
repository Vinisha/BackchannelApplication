e) Metrics calculation:- We are assigning a value to each day in year. 
   The metric which we used here is:
   @metric = post.Votes  + (@total_points - @days) + post.id
   We have given the total points as 180(since, a semester has 6 months at most with 30 days in each month.
   As the days go on, the difference between creation day and present day is calculated and subtracted from the total
   points. And the post id is taken as extra in case the values, post.Votes  and (total_points â€“ @days) become zero.
